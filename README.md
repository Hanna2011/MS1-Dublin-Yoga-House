### **Design Choices**
-----

### **Fonts**

- I have chosen Monserrat for the headings and menu as it is easy to read and has good contrast to the main body font
  which is Roboto. 

### **Colors**
- The main colors on the Dublin Yoga House websita are Space Cadet (22223B), Rich Black FOGRA 39 (0d0d0d), Silver Pink (c9ada7) and White (ffffff).

### **Imaginery**

### **Wireframes**
The wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The links are available below:
