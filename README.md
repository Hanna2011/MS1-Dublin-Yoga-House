### **Design Choices**

### **Fonts**

- I have chosen Monserrat for the headings and menu as it is easy to read and has good contrast to the main body font
  which is Roboto. 

### **Colors**
- The main colors on the Dublin Yoga House websita are Space Cadet (22223B), Rich Black FOGRA 39 (0d0d0d), Silver Pink (c9ada7) and White (ffffff).
